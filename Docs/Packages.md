# Packages

## All packages
The packages that we used for this repository are:
- @testing-library/jest-dom
- @testing-library/react
- @testing-library/user-event
- react
- react-dom
- react-scripts
- web-vitals
- axios
- bootstrap
- bootstrap-css
- react-router-dom
- react-toastify


## External packages
The first 7 packages are already in use when you make a new react project. The other packages were added manually with commands.
The commands for these are:
- axios: "npm i axios"
- bootstrap: "npm i bootstrap"
- bootstrap-css: "npm i bootstrap-css"
- react-router-dom: "npm i react-router-dom"
- react-toastify: "npm i react-toastify"


## Why did we use these?
The reason why we decided to use these external packages will be explained here.
- axios: axios is being used to make XMLHTTPRequest from the browser to give data from the front-end to the back-end.
- bootstrap & bootstrap-css: bootstrap and bootstrap-css are feature packed frontend toolkit which contain component for js and css ready items to use. This is so that we don't need to create a lot of custom js components and css files which are already a ton of made by the community.
- react-router-dom: react-router-dom is being used to specify the different pages and to navigate between them.
- react-toastify: react-toastify is used to get the pre-made notifications in this project. These notifications are used to give the user feedback if they did something succesfully or failed at doing something on the page.
