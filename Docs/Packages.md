## Why did we use these?
The reason why we decided to use these external packages will be explained here.
- axios: axios is being used to make XMLHTTPRequest from the browser to give data from the front-end to the back-end.
- bootstrap & bootstrap-css: bootstrap and bootstrap-css are feature packed frontend toolkit which contain component for js and css ready items to use. This is so that we don't need to create a lot of custom js components and css files which are already a ton of made by the community.
- jest: jest is a testing library that is being used in this project to make and run tests.
- react-router-dom: react-router-dom is being used to specify the different pages and to navigate between them.
- react-toastify: react-toastify is used to get the pre-made notifications in this project. These notifications are used to give the user feedback if they did something succesfully or failed at doing something on the page.
- sonarqube-scanner: the sonarQube scanner is a tool from a 3rd party that performs static code analysis. This package is used to get the code coverage that the tests are covering.
